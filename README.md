## House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

Link : - https://github.com/The-CS-Student/House-Prices-Kaggle-Competition

In this kaggle compeition I did advanced feature engineering to preprocess </br>
the house prices dataset. Then I use scikit-learn to apply Linear Regression </br>
model to the dataset

## Fashion MNIST

In this repository, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network on the </br>
Fashion MNIST dataset. The Framework Pytorch was used to do this.
